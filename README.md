================

SENIOR DEVELOPER / DEVOPS / WEB ARCHITECT
-----------------------------------------

### SUMMARY

Senior software engineer with over two decades of experience and high level of expertise in all aspects of production for Web including development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Although I do have a degree in informatics and mathematics, I admit that most of my knowledge comes from real-life experience. Since 1999, when we started a small Web design company with a couple of friends, I have worked with a lot of software stacks and Web technologies, from LAMP (Linux, MySQL, Apache, PHP) and Ruby on Rails to MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js), Golang, Erlang and Elixir. One of the main things I believe in is that keeping oneself up-to-date with the latest trends is the only way to stay on top in such rapidly changing industry as IT.
