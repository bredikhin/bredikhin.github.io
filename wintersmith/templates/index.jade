        | While holding a degree in informatics and mathematics, I admit that most of my knowledge comes from the real life experience. Since 1999, when we started a small Web design company with a couple of friends, I have worked with a lot of software stacks and Web technologies, from with LAMP (Linux, MySQL, Apache, PHP) to Ruby on Rails and MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js). One of the main things I believe in is that keeping up-to-date with the latest trends is the only way to stay on top in such rapidly changing industry as IT.

        | Finally, though I started mainly as programmer (with a slight flavour of management) and I still code a lot, I have to acknowledge the fact that my interests shifted a lot into DevOps and architecting during the recent years (probably, as cloud computing matured). Solving big problems with less resources is something that really attracts me. And something I got really good at.
