Yesterday, I stumbled upon [an interview][infoworld] [DHH][dhh] gave about
seven years ago. As usually, pretty strong language.

Ruby on Rails vs the Enterprise
===============================

One of his comments (regarding the future of Ruby on Rails),
for example, was:

> My dream is that people adopt it on its own merits. We're not trying to bend
> Ruby on Rails to fit the enterprise, we're encouraging enterprises to bend
> to Ruby on Rails. Come if you like it, stay away if you don't. We're not
> going head over heels to accommodate the enterprise or to lure them away
> from Java. That's how you end up with Java, if you start bending to special
> interest groups.

Almost seven years later (saw him a couple of days ago started [a series of
debates][is tdd dead] on TDD with [Martin Fowler][fowler] and
[Kent Beck][beck]), the guy still sticks to his guns, is still independent and
successful (seems like [Basecamp][bc] is doing great). What can I say?
Hats off.

(Though Java is not going anywhere and RoR is far from overcoming it).
