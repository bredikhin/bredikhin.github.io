Workspace Retrospective
=======================

The curious thing is that there's actually more devices on the last photo
(there are two [Arduinos][arduino] on the table, a [Beaglebone Black][bbb]
and a [Raspberry Pi][pi] behind the monitors), the stuff is just getting
smaller. Which seems like a common trend in technology though.
