Personally, I always considered those list blog posts kind
of cliche, but on the other hand, having such
superstitions is kind of cliche too, and I decided to write

tools we have as of this writing.

5 PHP Deployment Tools
======================

Recently, I had to come up with some thoughts on deploying
several PHP projects (yeah, I know, but sometimes it's already
chosen, and there's just not much you can do about it), and
a quick research gave me these five tools that look like a
good fit for the job. 

# Why not just Capistrano?

Good question. Actually, that's what I always did before. ...

# WePloy

# Altax

# Deployer

# Magallanes

# Rocketeer

# Or something else?
