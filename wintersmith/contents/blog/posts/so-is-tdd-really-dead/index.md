In a recent (sort of historical) [series of debates][is tdd dead]
[DHH][dhh], [Martin Fowler][fowler] and [Kent Beck][beck]) are trying to
understand whether [TDD][tdd] is good or evil nowadays.

So, is TDD really dead?
=======================

There's actually several things about these debates that are truly
fascinating. For starters, even with some occasional swearing by DHH,
these polemics seem really civilized, much more than, let's say, most of
political debates. Seriously, how wonderful it is to see people with such
different points of view and even from completely different generations
being so tolerant and respectful to each other's opinions!

Then, there is this passion. It's just such a pleasure to see these smart
and talented men talking about what they are doing with such inspiration
and belief. Yeah, I know, it may sound a bit corny, but sometimes it's just
that simple.

Ultimately, the most important thing about these talks is the fact that
in spite of all efforts to position them as polemics, all three participants
are, essentially, agree with one another. Specifically, on the following
matters:

- your application code must be tested;
- you don't have to have a 100% (or even more) test coverage, but what can
get broken should have tests;
- whether you write tests before the actual code or after, those tests
shouldn't damage the architecture of your application.
